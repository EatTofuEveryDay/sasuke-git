# sasuke-git
Version management with an extra dose of anime

sasuke-git is a cmdline wrapper for common git commands. Instructions to use as follows:

- `sasuke uchiha` becomes `git clone`
- `sasuke 7/23` becomes `git init` (his canon birthday)
- `sasuke kunai` becomes `git add`
- `sasuke choke` becomes `git rm`
- `sasuke speed` becomes `git mv`
- `sasuke sharingan` becomes `git pull`
- `sasuke vs itachi` becomes `git commit`
- `sasuke vs naruto` becomes `git push`
- `sasuke x naruto` becomes `git submodule`
- `sasuke x sakura` or `sasuke x uselessness` becomes `git diff`

The rest of the cmdline arguments are piped to git.
If you like it, consider adding the project directory to your $PATH.
