# sasuke-git
Version management with an extra dose of anime

sasuke-git is a cmdline wrapper for common git commands. Instructions to use as follows:

- `sasuke uchiha` becomes `git clone`
- `sasuke kunai` becomes `git add`
- `sasuke choke` becomes `git rm`
- more..

The rest of the cmdline arguments are piped to git. If you like it, consider adding the project directory to your path.
